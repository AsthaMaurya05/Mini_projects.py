# 🐍 Python Quiz Portal

A **phase-wise, exam‑oriented Python Quiz Portal** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The project is designed to help learners **master Python step by step**, from core fundamentals to advanced concepts, using carefully curated MCQs inspired by **real exam patterns, interviews, and common trap questions**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Python Quiz Portal is not a random-question app. Instead, it follows a **structured learning path**, divided into **8 progressive phases**, ensuring strong conceptual clarity before moving to advanced topics.

Each phase:

* Focuses on a specific Python topic
* Contains **30 MCQs**
* Includes **navigation, review, and timer support**
* Helps identify weak areas through practice

## 🧩 Quiz Phases

### **Phase 1: Python Core Foundations**

Covers syntax, indentation, variables, identifiers, keywords, dynamic typing, and basic Python behavior.

### **Phase 2: Python Data Types & Data Handling**

Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, mutability vs immutability, slicing, and indexing.

### **Phase 3: Operators & Expressions**

Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, bitwise operators, precedence, and expression evaluation.

### **Phase 4: Control Flow & Loops**

`if-else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and loop‑else logic patterns.

### **Phase 5: Functions & Recursion**

Function creation, arguments, return values, default parameters, `*args`, `**kwargs`, and recursion basics.

### **Phase 6: Advanced Python Concepts**

List & dictionary comprehensions, lambda functions, `map/filter/reduce`, shallow vs deep copy, memory references, and `id()`.

### **Phase 7: OOPS in Python**

Classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and important dunder methods.

### **Phase 8: Exception Handling & File Handling**

`try-except`, custom exceptions, file operations, file modes, reading, writing, and appending.
