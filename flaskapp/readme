# 📝 Flask To-Do List Web App

A simple yet practical **To-Do List web application** built using **Flask** as part of my **PEP Python Full Stack classes**.
This project helped me understand how frontend and backend communicate in a real web application using Flask.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Flask To-Do List App allows users to:

* Add new tasks
* View all tasks dynamically
* Delete tasks
* Store data persistently using a database

It focuses on understanding the **core Flask workflow**, rather than heavy UI or complex features.

---

## ✨ Features

* ➕ Add new tasks with description
* ❌ Delete existing tasks
* 🗂 Persistent storage using SQLite
* 🔄 Dynamic rendering with Jinja2 templates
* 🧭 Clean and simple UI

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python** – Backend logic
* **Flask** – Web framework
* **HTML5** – Structure
* **CSS3** – Styling
* **SQLite** – Database
* **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for database operations
* **Jinja2** – Template engine

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy
```

3. Run the Flask app

```bash
